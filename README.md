# Nucleus
Nucleus is a bytecode driven language initially developed to be a learning experience for myself in creating my own programming language. Much of the base workings of Nucleus stems from the [crafting-interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) book, which has been an excellent resource for building a solid foundation for the main goals of Nucleus. These being, a solidly reliable scripting language that aims to have a (decently) rich native library, break some of the norms of traditional language lexicology, define better interoperability between dynamic typings, and be easily accesible. More on these goals can be found below.

# Getting Started
Currently Nucleus is still in the main foundational development phase, and as such is not easily accesible to play with. At this stage this repository can be downloaded and an executable can be compiled to have a play with the REPL and Script exection.
